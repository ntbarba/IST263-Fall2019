<body>
    <p>My name is Nick Barba and I'm an aspiring entrepreneur, studying at Whitman School of Management. My passion lies in making meaningful connections with people and discovering ways to make them more effective. Iâ€™m a Global Media Fellow at the Blackstone LaunchPad at Syracuse University, which has given me opportunities to speak with entrepreneurs pursuing their unique solutions to common problems. A firm believer in serving those in society that are more vulnerable, underrepresented and unsupported, I am a champion of organizing events that fundraise for important causes and arm community members with the information they need to continue helping those in need. I hope to combine my social impact mindset with my passion for entrepreneurship in a business development role in a startup or small company. </p>
