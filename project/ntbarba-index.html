            <h2>The 6 Degrees of Separation</h2>
            <p>The six degrees of separation is the theory that every person on the planet is connected to any other person through a chain of no more than five intermediaries. First proposed in 1929 by Frigyes Karinthy in a short story called "Chains," the theory was tested and supported by Stanley Milgram in something he called the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_experiment" target="_blank">Small World Problem</a>."
                <br/><br/>
                In 2008, Microsoft validated the experiment by analyzing the minimum chain length required to connect 180 million different pairs of users with accounts. They found the average chain to be 6.6 hops. Since then, Facebook claims to have reduced 6.6 to 3.5 degrees through their vast and interconnected network.

                <img src="img/profile-me.jpg" alt="picture of Nick Barba">
                <p>My name is Nick Barba and I am a senior undergraduate student at Whitman. I am studying Entrepreneurship and Finance and minoring in Information Management &amp; Technologies at the iSchool. I've spent my college experience focusing on the importance of relationship building your professional and personal life. I've applied this to my drive for entrepreneurship and am currently working on a way to reverse the trend of using social media to maintain our core relatioships. In that respect, I've created this website as a project for my Introduction to Front-End Web Development class as a means to visualize the relationships faculty have built in their time; and how they are all interconnected.</p>
