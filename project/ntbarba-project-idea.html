  <h1>IST263 Project Idea</h1>
  <h2>The Whitman Faculty Network</h2>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>This website will serve the purpose of showing Whitman faculty how much of them know each other directly and indirectly. 
      A study in by Stanley Milgram in 1967 demonstrated to the world that everyone is connected through 6 degrees of separation.
      In 2008, O2 concluded that the number is now closer to 3. This project aims to show faculty that although they may not 
      know every colleague, the school is one big webbed family. The project will include short interviews of staff, a picture, 
      and asking them 3 people they know. I will interview those 3 people, and so on.
