  <h1>IST263 Project Idea</h1>
  <h2>The Whitman Faculty Network</h2>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>This website will serve the purpose of showing <abbr title="Martin J. Whitman School of Management">Whitman</abbr> faculty 
      how much of them know each other directly and indirectly. A study in by Stanley Milgram in 1967 demonstrated to the world 
      that everyone is connected through 6 degrees of separation. In 2008, <abbr title="Telefonica UK Limited">O2</abbr> concluded 
      that the number is now closer to 3. This project aims to show faculty that although they may not know every colleague, the 
      school is one big webbed family. The project will include short interviews of staff, a picture, and asking them 3 people 
      they know. I will interview those 3 people, and so on.

  <h3>Sourcing Content</h3>
  <p>All content produced and displayed on the website will be my own intellectual property and sourced through interviews. 
      For example, all photos will be taken at the time of the short interview. Other images needed for the website design 
      will be sourced through Google, ensuring they are lebeled for free reuse. Other information, including their answer to 
      the interview question, "What brought you to Syracuse?", and the 3 people they know will also be sourced in the faculty 
      interviews.
