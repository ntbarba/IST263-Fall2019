        <h2>What led me to Whitman?</h2>
        <p>True to what we teach in Whitman I was led here by networking. George Burman, former chair of the EEE department, sought out my experience and expertise to cover one course for one semester. That was in 2012 and I havenâ€™t had more fun at work since I started teaching.</p>
